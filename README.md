# Projects
Here are some projects and algorithms I wrote at university.

---
### Red ball 0 (C++ project):

The game is heavily inspired by popular Red ball series of games.
The objective is to complete segments of difficult parkour
reaching the end of the level. This was a semester project, so the
game isn't polished! Enjoy the terrible grafics, hardcore levels and
complicated level redactor.

### Catch-up (C++ project):

This is game, where you are chased by green robots and try to survive
for as long as possible. It is a test of **Fortune's algorithm of
Voronoi diagram** and path-finding algorithms.

### Earthquaker (Python project):

Small clicker game on Python. This was a semester project, but it
still has some charm :D

### Algorithms:

This is a compilation of tricky algorithms we've learned at university.
Each algorithm has a link to the task on Codeforces that it solves.
Feel free to use them in your projects.
