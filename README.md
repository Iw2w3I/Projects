# Projects
Here are some projects and algorithms I wrote at university.

---
### Red ball 0 (C++ project):

The game is heavily inspired by popular Red ball series of games.
The objective is to complete segments of difficult parkour
reaching the end of the level. This was a semester project, so the
game isn't polished! Enjoy the terrible grafics, hardcore levels and
complicated level redactor.

### Chess (C++ project):

The project is inspired by lichess.org amazing board redactor for chess.
The program allows you to play chess from a custom board position and see your previous moves and board positions.
Unfortunately, project does not support multiplayer and playing against a bot, but it already was a complicated coding challenge for me in school.

### Catch-up (C++ project):

This is the game, where you are chased by green robots and try to survive
for as long as possible. It is a test of **Fortune's algorithm of
Voronoi diagram** and path-finding algorithms.

### Earthquaker (Python project):

Small clicker game on Python. This was a semester project, but it
still has some charm :D

### Algorithms:

This is a compilation of tricky algorithms we've learned at university.
Each algorithm has a link to the task on Codeforces that it solves.
Feel free to use them in your projects.
