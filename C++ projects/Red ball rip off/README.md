# Red ball 0

---

### Description:

The game is heavily inspired by popular Red ball series of games.
The objective is to complete segments of difficult parkour
reaching the end of the level. This was a semester project, so the
game isn't polished! Enjoy the terrible grafics, hardcore levels and
complicated level redactor.
